# Snake
This is the classic snake game built using turtle in Python. 
Written using PyCharm 

## Support 
If you have any questions about how this game works, how to install and test it, and any errors you may find, please email me at jeremiahahwthorne828@gmail.com. 


## Future Ideas: 
1. Making it into a full fledged mobile app. 
2. Transferring it over to PyGame to improve the graphics and general game quality. 
3. Just general UI imporvements 
4. Improving the actual snake, and the turtle logic to make it less laggy and look much better.

>pip install turtle
